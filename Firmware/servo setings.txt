[servo probe_dock_servo]
pin: P2.0            # P2.0 is for Skr 1.4, use the appropriate pin for your MCU
#   PWM output pin controlling the servo. This parameter must be
#   provided.
maximum_servo_angle: 180
#   The maximum angle (in degrees) that this servo can be set to. The
#   default is 180 degrees.
minimum_pulse_width: 0.0005
#   The minimum pulse width time (in seconds). This should correspond
#   with an angle of 0 degrees. The default is 0.001 seconds.
maximum_pulse_width: 0.0025
#   The maximum pulse width time (in seconds). This should correspond
#   with an angle of maximum_servo_angle. The default is 0.002
#   seconds.
initial_angle: 150  # to edit for your case
#   Initial angle (in degrees) to set the servo to. The default is to
#   not send any signal at startup.
#initial_pulse_width:
#   Initial pulse width time (in seconds) to set the servo to. (This
#   is only valid if initial_angle is not set.) The default is to not
#   send any signal at startup.
